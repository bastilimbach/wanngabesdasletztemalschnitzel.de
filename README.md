## About
At my current employer, we have a great cantine which serves really good food, especially if it's time for [Schnitzel](https://www.google.de/search?q=schnitzel&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWoaiXx8zcAhWBuywKHbP9DkYQ_AUICigB&biw=1440&bih=743). Because of that, I created this humorous Schnitzel Countdown to know the exact amount of days the last Schnitzel was served.
